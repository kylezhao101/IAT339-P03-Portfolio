        <h3>Project Overview</h3>
        <p>In this project, I utilized Youtube-DL, Asyncio, and Discord.py to create a multi-threaded, Youtube and Soundcloud music music player bot for users to listen and manipulate through their Discord applications using text commands.</p>

        <p>With MongoDB integration, bot users are able manage and play their favorite songs. </p>

        <p>As this is one of my first coding projects, I learned how to Google effectively in order to learn and debug new and unfamilliar APIs. Throughout the process of creating this bot, I further gained knowledge in these APIs through reading documentation, viewing examples and looking for solutions to my issues on stackoverflow.</p>
        <h3>Issues</h3>
        <p>This bot uses Youtube-dl to scrape and retrieve audio files from Youtube.com, however it has been abandoned as of 2021.12.17. The current bot uses a fork of Youtube-dl, yt-dlp which continues to adapt as the official Youtube site changes. Thus, my bot requires constant use and maintainance, which involves bug-fixing and updating code whenever Youtube makes changes.</p>
